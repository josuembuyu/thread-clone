# ThreadClone - Social Media Simulation

I'm embarking on an ambitious project, "ThreadClone," designed to replicate the functionality of renowned social media platforms for educational and experimental purposes. Beyond being a mock social media platform, I aim to provide a comprehensive learning experience for developers and enthusiasts. This project covers:

- I'll master Next.js 13.4 with Server Side Rendering.
- I'll learn MongoDB handling of complex schemas, multiple data population.
- I'll create beautiful layouts with TailwindCSS.
- I'll use Clerk for authentication.
- I'll handle file uploads with UploadThing.
- I'll explore Shadcn components.
- I'll listen to real-time events with webhooks.
- I'll understand middleware, API actions, and authorization.
- I'll explore & integrate new Next.js layout route groups.
- I'll validate data with Zod.
- I'll manage forms with react hook form.
- I'll create reusable components.
- I'll build a solid application architecture.
  
ThreadClone integrates advanced technologies and best practices, allowing me to explore, experiment, and enhance my development skills while creating and customizing this simulated social media platform.
